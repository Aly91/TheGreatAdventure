The aim of my project is to create a 2D sidecrolling platform/adventure game. It will have level progression as well as enemies and power-up. The written will be written entirely in Java using the Eclipse Mars IDE. I will also learn to use and encorporate the Slick 2D and LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library) libraries in order to complete my assignment.

The premise of the game is quite simple, the player starts from the left of the screen and the goal is to get from point a to pont b while overcoming obstacles and defeating enemies along the way. Once the player has come to the end of the level, they automatically progress to the next level.
